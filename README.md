# RichTea

Welcome to my very first programming language!  I hope you like it.  I implore you to use `RichTea` in all your production environments regardless of use-case or the fact that it has many limitations (features).

`RichTea` is a hobby project which, if nothing else, is an interesting resource and reference point to use when learning to design and implement a simple programming language.

## Installation

`RichTea` makes use of the `gradle` build process - If you are familiar with `gradle` compilation should be straight forward.

# More documentation to come!
